# LogiOps

![Build Status](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)

This is an unofficial driver for Logitech mice and keyboard.

This is currently only compatible with HID++ \>2.0 devices.

## Configuration
[Refer to the wiki for details.](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/wiki/Configuration)

You may also refer to [logid.example.cfg](./logid.example.cfg) for an example.

Default location for the configuration file is /etc/logid.cfg, but another can be specified using the `-c` flag.

## Dependencies

This project requires a C++20 compiler, `cmake`, `libevdev`, `libudev`, `glib`, and `libconfig`.
For popular distributions, I've included commands below.

**Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake libevdev libconfig systemd-libs glib2`

**Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libevdev-dev libudev-dev libconfig++-dev libglib2.0-dev`

**Fedora:** `sudo dnf install cmake libevdev-devel systemd-devel libconfig-devel gcc-c++ glib2-devel`

**Gentoo Linux:** `sudo emerge dev-libs/libconfig dev-libs/libevdev dev-libs/glib dev-util/cmake virtual/libudev`

**Solus:** `sudo eopkg install cmake libevdev-devel libconfig-devel libgudev-devel glib2-devel`

**openSUSE:** `sudo zypper install cmake libevdev-devel systemd-devel libconfig-devel gcc-c++ libconfig++-devel libudev-devel glib2-devel`

## Building

To build this project, run:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

To install, run `sudo make install` after building. You can set the daemon to start at boot by running `sudo systemctl enable logid` or `sudo systemctl enable --now logid` if you want to enable and start the daemon.

## Development

The project may only run as root, but for development purposes, you may find it
convenient to run as non-root on the user bus. You must compile with the CMake
flag `-DUSE_USER_BUS=ON` to use the user bus.

## Donate
This program is (and will always be) provided free of charge. If you would like to support the development of this project by donating, you can donate to my Ko-Fi below.
